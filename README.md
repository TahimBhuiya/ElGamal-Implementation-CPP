# üîê ElGamal Encryption and Decryption in C++  
**By Tahim Bhuiya**

This is a C++ implementation of the **ElGamal public-key cryptosystem**, which encrypts and decrypts text using asymmetric cryptography based on modular arithmetic and discrete logarithms.

---

## üìú Overview  
ElGamal is an asymmetric-key encryption algorithm used for secure data exchange. This project simulates ElGamal by:

- Generating a large prime number `q`  
- Finding a generator `g` for the finite field modulo `q`  
- Generating a private key and computing the corresponding public key  
- Performing asymmetric encryption using a random session key  
- Decrypting ciphertext using modular inverse and private key  

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage  

Compile and run the C++ program:  
```bash
g++ "ElGamal Implementation - C++.cpp" -o ElGamal && ./ElGamal
```

Then:  
- Enter the key size in bits (e.g., 8, 12, 16)  
- Enter the plaintext message to encrypt  

The program will output:  
- The generated prime number `q`  
- Public and private keys  
- Encrypted ciphertext as pairs of integers `(p1, p2)`  
- Decrypted plaintext

## üß™ Example Output  
```
Enter the key size in bits (preferably 8, 12, 16): 12

Prime Number (q): 4093
Public Key: 2225
Private Key: 1346

Enter the plaintext: hello

Ciphertext: (3078, 1251) (3078, 2423) (3078, 3222) (3078, 1251) (3078, 1439) 

Decrypted Plaintext: hello
```

## üì¶ Requirements  
- C++ compiler (g++, clang++)  
- Standard C++ libraries (iostream, vector, etc.)  

---

## ‚úÖ Notes  
- The plaintext is handled character by character, encrypting ASCII values.  
- Prime generation uses a basic Fermat primality test; stronger tests could be implemented for more security.  
- The key size should be small (e.g., 8 to 16 bits) for reasonable runtime and demonstration purposes.  
- The ciphertext is a vector of integer pairs representing encrypted characters.  
- Randomness depends on seeding with `time(0)`.
